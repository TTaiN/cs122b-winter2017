# About
Fabflix is a movie rental website developed for University of California, Irvine's CS 122B (Projects in Databases and Web Applications) Winter 2017 course. It is implemented mostly using Java servlets, and is designed with a multi-layer architecture system. Using a MySQL database as its data backend, Fabflix simulates an eCommerce web application, with features implemented in various different languages and techniques that represent the learning process of each individual team member. This repository acts as a portfolio for our work.
